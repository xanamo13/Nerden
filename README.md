This was my final project for a web class this past Spring semester. I will admit, certain pages are much more polished than others. Overall, I am happy with how ti tured out despite the parts that I'm sure I could work on a bit more. 


NOTES:
  - There are many parts of the website that seem a bit random, like the links to Mozilla and Microsoft in the Similar Stores file. This is just beacuse it was required in the project by the Professor.
  - The forms are not fully validated at all. This site was for Intermediate Web, which had little to no requirements for validation and more back-end programming.
  - As stated in the Design Document, quite a few images are from the FreePik site. They are under a Free License. 

Extras that I did not get to do:
  - I wanted to do a full form for the Jobs page where the user could fill out an appkication and "apply" (it wouldn't go through, since no back-end programming was involved) for a job.
  - Similar to the job form, I wanted to create a form for the "events" artist pop-up section. I though that would've been a neat addition.
  - More in-depth form validation (phone number pattern, perhaps some sort of DOB validation on certain forms, etc.)
  - Clickable shop items, right now they are just images. 

Things I could've worked on/done better: 
  - I think one thing I could've done better was the actual content on the site. For example, quite a few pages are just text, which is fine but I think it can make the site look a bit bare and unfinished.
  - Visual appeal, specifically on the Home/Index page. That image banner is not the best when it comes to contrast. As for the other parts of the site, I think it's okay, but I think I needed to think about the color scheme a bit more.
  - Responsiveness: The site is responsive enough to where elemants don't get immensely squished and overlapped, however there are some elements that needed some work to make them responsive in a better way. One example is the Shop page. As the screen gets smaller, so does tha table. While the table doesn't break on itself, this could make it harder for the user to interact with those items.
  - Cleaner code: The code works, but because I had other projects and kind of had to work on this one intervally, my code is a bit messy. I'm sure there a a few lines of code that are not needed

Things I like about the site:
  - The fonts are nice, and I think the color scheme is nice despite the boldness.
  - I really like how the logos in the footer turned out.
  - I like the shop items even though they're not clickable. I think the layout is nice.
  - Even though certain parts of the site are definitely unfinished, I like the overall cleanliness of the site. (Minus the home banner)
